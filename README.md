So i tried to make a website using Backbone JS.

At first, i hated backbone because of things like having to have to create a `new` instance of every class when i needed and having to wire everything together, finding a template to use, etc. It was a lot of work just to get started.

Now, i actually like it more (largely due to me being a more experience/confident developer compared to when i first used it) because it sync well a backend database and abstracts away of having to define the actual requests for CRUD operations.

I actually like Knockout over Backbone because it's simple, easy, and powerful.

However, Angular and React still are my favorites and weapons of choice! It's hard for me to choose between these two.
